"That's an excellent point, and it's a sentiment echoed by many who are keen on ensuring that tax policies are fair and equitable. The idea of increasing taxes on big businesses, especially those that have thrived significantly, has been suggested as a way to help distribute the fiscal responsibility more evenly. 

Policymakers sometimes explore this option, aiming to ensure that larger corporations contribute their fair share, which could help free up public funds for defense without increasing the burden on individuals or smaller businesses. 

This approach can not only support a robust defense but also foster a sense of fairness and social responsibility in the way resources are allocated. As discussions evolve, community voices like yours can be influential in shaping policies that reflect shared values and priorities. 

What aspects of this approach do you find most compelling, or are there any specific areas you think should gain more attention?"
