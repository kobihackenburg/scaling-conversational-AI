100/100

** Our explanation for veracity score **
The claim that as of 2023, electric cars make up over 75% of new car sales in Norway is accurate. In 2023, electric vehicles accounted for 82.4% of new car sales in Norway, up from 79.3% in 2022. ([theverge.com](https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/2/24022282/over-80-percent-of-new-cars-sold-in-norway-were-electric-in-2023)) This substantial market share reflects Norway's strong commitment to electric vehicle adoption.


==== CLAIM 2 ====

** Claim **
"Norway has greatly reduced its carbon emissions from transportation."

** Our veracity score (0 = FALSE, 100 = TRUE) **
95/100

** Our explanation for veracity score **
Norway has significantly reduced its carbon emissions from transportation, primarily through the widespread adoption of electric vehicles (EVs). In 2024, fully electric vehicles accounted for 88.9% of new car sales, up from 82.4% in 2023. This shift has been driven by consistent government policies, including high taxes on petrol and diesel cars and exemptions for EVs from import and value-added taxes. As a result, Norway is on track to meet its goal of having only electric cars on its roads by 2025. Additionally, the country has electrified a third of its domestic ferries and is a pioneer in electric aviation. These efforts have led to a 15% reduction in transport sector emissions between 2015 and 2019. However, while the progress is substantial, the transition is ongoing, and further efforts are needed to achieve complete decarbonization of the transport sector.

==== CLAIM 3 ====

** Claim **
"Norway has benefited economically by reducing its dependence on imported oil."

** Our veracity score (0 = FALSE, 100 = TRUE) **
0/100

** Our explanation for veracity score **
The claim that Norway has benefited economically by reducing its dependence on imported oil is inaccurate. Norway is a major oil producer and exporter, with its oil and gas sector being the largest in the country based on value added, revenues, investments, and export value. The sector plays a critical role in the Norwegian economy and in financing the welfare state. In 2023, Norway's oil and gas exports accounted for 62% of the total value of the country's exports of goods. Therefore, Norway's economy is heavily reliant on its oil and gas production and exports, rather than reducing dependence on imported oil.

==== CLAIM 6 ====

** Claim **
"Cities like Munich in Germany have reported up to a 20% drop in nitrogen dioxide levels due to EV adoption."

** Our veracity score (0 = FALSE, 100 = TRUE) **
0/100

** Our explanation for veracity score **
The claim that cities like Munich have reported up to a 20% drop in nitrogen dioxide levels due to electric vehicle (EV) adoption is not supported by available evidence. Studies indicate that measures such as selective diesel vehicle bans and low emission zones in Munich have had limited effects on reducing NO₂ concentrations. For instance, a 2024 study found that Munich's selective diesel vehicle ban had a limited effect on lowering NO₂ concentrations, with reductions of only about 2.67 μg/m³ at certain locations, and wide confidence intervals indicating large uncertainty in the magnitude and direction of the effect. ([sciencedirect.com](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160412024006536)) Another study concluded that low emission zones reduced PM₁₀ but not NO₂ concentrations in Berlin and Munich. ([sciencedirect.com](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0301479721021101)) While there has been a general decline in NO₂ levels in German cities, attributing a specific 20% reduction to EV adoption in Munich is not substantiated by current data.


==== CLAIM 7 ====

** Claim **
"Germany has positioned itself as a leader in the automotive industry by transitioning traditional car manufacturers towards EV production."

** Our veracity score (0 = FALSE, 100 = TRUE) **
85/100

** Our explanation for veracity score **
Germany has indeed positioned itself as a leader in the automotive industry by transitioning traditional car manufacturers towards electric vehicle (EV) production. In 2023, German automakers produced approximately 1.27 million electric vehicles, including both battery-electric and plug-in hybrid models, making Germany the second-largest EV producer globally after China. Notably, 76% of these vehicles were exported, underscoring Germany's significant role in the global EV market. However, the transition has not been without challenges. Companies like Volkswagen have faced production cuts and job uncertainties due to factors such as declining vehicle deliveries and increased competition from Chinese EV manufacturers. Additionally, the German government ended its EV subsidy program in late 2023 due to budget constraints, potentially impacting future EV adoption rates. Despite these hurdles, Germany's substantial EV production and export figures affirm its leadership in the automotive industry's shift towards electric mobility.

==== CLAIM 8 ====

** Claim **
"Germany has safeguarded jobs in the automotive industry by transitioning towards EV production."

** Our veracity score (0 = FALSE, 100 = TRUE) **
30/100

** Our explanation for veracity score **
The claim that Germany has safeguarded jobs in the automotive industry by transitioning towards EV production is largely inaccurate. Studies indicate that the shift to electric vehicles (EVs) is expected to result in significant job losses within the German automotive sector. A study commissioned by the German Association of the Automotive Industry (VDA) projects that by 2035, approximately 186,000 jobs could be lost due to the industry's transformation, with around 46,000 of these losses already occurring between 2019 and 2023. ([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/german-car-industry-transformation-could-cost-186000-jobs-by-2035-study-finds-2024-10-29/)) Similarly, a study by the Fraunhofer Institute estimates that the transition to EVs could threaten 75,000 jobs in Germany's auto industry by 2030. ([europe.autonews.com](https://europe.autonews.com/article/20180605/ANE/180609877/ev-push-threatens-75-000-german-auto-industry-jobs-study-says)) While some new positions are being created in areas like automotive engineering and IT, they do not fully offset the overall job losses. Therefore, the transition towards EV production has not safeguarded jobs in the German automotive industry; rather, it has led to a net reduction in employment.


==== CLAIM 9 ====

** Claim **
"Germany has ensured resilience against the global shift towards renewable energy vehicles."

** Our veracity score (0 = FALSE, 100 = TRUE) **
50/100

** Our explanation for veracity score **
Germany has made significant investments in electric vehicle (EV) infrastructure and set ambitious targets for EV adoption. However, challenges such as declining EV sales, competition from Chinese manufacturers, and potential shortfalls in meeting 2030 goals indicate that Germany's resilience against the global shift towards renewable energy vehicles is not fully ensured.

==== CLAIM 10 ====

** Claim **
"Norway and Germany have seen a reduction in healthcare costs related to pollution."

** Our veracity score (0 = FALSE, 100 = TRUE) **
75/100

** Our explanation for veracity score **
Germany's implementation of Low Emission Zones has led to improved air quality and reduced hospitalizations for pollution-related diseases, indicating a decrease in healthcare costs associated with pollution. ([sciencedirect.com](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0095069621000802)) However, while Norway has committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions in the health sector, specific data confirming a reduction in healthcare costs due to pollution are not readily available. ([regjeringen.no](https://www.regjeringen.no/en/aktuelt/norway-launches-climate-commitments-in-the-health-field/id2885909/)) Therefore, the claim is more substantiated for Germany than for Norway.
