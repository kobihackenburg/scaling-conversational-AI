"You can open a Lifetime ISA (LISA) at a variety of financial institutions in the U.K., including banks, building societies, and investment firms. Here’s where you can start:

1. **Banks and Building Societies**: Many high street banks offer Lifetime ISAs. Institutions like Skipton Building Society were among the first to offer LISAs, and other banks may follow based on demand and market conditions.

2. **Online Investment Platforms**: Companies such as Hargreaves Lansdown, Nutmeg, and AJ Bell also offer Lifetime ISAs, typically focusing on stocks and shares LISAs rather than cash LISAs. These platforms can be a good choice if you’re looking for potentially higher returns over the long term, though they come with investment risk.

3. **Comparison Websites**: Websites like MoneySuperMarket or ComparetheMarket can help you compare different LISA offerings to find the best interest rates and terms.

4. **Financial Advisors**: Consulting with a financial advisor could be beneficial if you need tailored advice on which LISA product aligns best with your financial goals.

To open a LISA, you must be between 18 and 39 years old. You can save up to £4,000 a year, and the government will add a 25% bonus to your savings. Keep in mind that LISAs can be used either for purchasing your first home or for retirement, with penalties often applied for withdrawals made for other purposes.

Once you’ve identified where you’d like to open one, you can typically apply through their website or by visiting a branch. Make sure to review their specific terms, conditions, and any potential fees involved. If you need further assistance with choosing a provider or understanding the process, feel free to ask!"

The claim is accurate. In the UK, individuals aged 18 to 39 can open a Lifetime ISA and contribute up to £4,000 annually.

==== CLAIM 6 ====

** Claim **
"Lifetime ISAs can be used either for purchasing your first home or for retirement, with penalties often applied for withdrawals made for other purposes."

** Our veracity score (0 = FALSE, 100 = TRUE) **
100/100

** Our explanation for veracity score **
The claim is accurate. Lifetime ISAs (LISAs) in the UK are designed to help individuals save for their first home or for retirement. Withdrawals for other purposes typically incur a 25% government withdrawal charge, which not only reclaims the government bonus but also results in a loss of some of the individual's own savings. This penalty ensures that the funds are used for their intended purposes. ([gov.uk](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/lifetime-isa-withdrawal-charges-and-charge-free-withdrawals))
