"Certainly! Here are some key statistics and findings from countries that have legalized cannabis, which could be valuable for discussions and advocacy:

1. **Canada**:
   - Since legalizing recreational cannabis in 2018, Canada has reported a reduction in the illegal cannabis market, with Statistics Canada noting that by 2020, nearly half of cannabis users reported buying their cannabis legally.
   - The Canadian government has also generated substantial tax revenue; within the first year, it collected over CAD 186 million from cannabis excise and sales taxes.

2. **United States (Colorado and Washington as examples)**:
   - After legalization in 2012, Colorado and Washington reported decreases in illegal cannabis sales and related crime. A study published in the journal *Regional Science and Urban Economics* indicated a decrease in violent crime rates in states along the Mexican border post-legalization.
   - Colorado alone saw over USD 387 million in tax revenue from cannabis sales in 2020, which has been reinvested in infrastructure, education, and public health initiatives.

3. **Uruguay**:
   - As the first country to legalize cannabis nationwide in 2013, Uruguay took a regulated approach focusing on harm reduction and public health. The Institute of Regulation and Control of Cannabis indicates that nearly 50% of registered users report buying from licensed sellers, reducing illicit market influence.

4. **Portugal** (decriminalization model):
   - While Portugal decriminalized all drugs in 2001 rather than legalized, their approach shows a significant reduction in drug-related harm. Drug-related deaths and HIV infections among drug users fell sharply, and incarceration for drug offenses decreased.

These examples highlight the potential benefits of a legal and regulated cannabis market, including crime reduction, increased tax revenue, and improvements in public health metrics. Sharing these statistics can help illustrate the practical, positive outcomes of reforming cannabis laws and the broader societal benefits that can be achieved through legalization or decriminalization."

======== FACT-CHECKABLE CLAIMS ========


==== CLAIM 1 ====

** Claim **
"Since legalizing recreational cannabis in 2018, Canada has reported a reduction in the illegal cannabis market, with Statistics Canada noting that by 2020, nearly half of cannabis users reported buying their cannabis legally."

** Our veracity score (0 = FALSE, 100 = TRUE) **
95/100

** Our explanation for veracity score **
The claim is largely accurate. Statistics Canada reported that by 2020, 68% of cannabis users obtained at least some of their cannabis from legal sources, up from 23% in 2018. This indicates a significant reduction in the illegal cannabis market following legalization. However, the claim that 'nearly half of cannabis users reported buying their cannabis legally' by 2020 is slightly conservative, as the actual figure is higher. Therefore, the veracity score is 95.


==== CLAIM 2 ====

** Claim **
"Within the first year of legalizing recreational cannabis, the Canadian government collected over CAD 186 million from cannabis excise and sales taxes."

** Our veracity score (0 = FALSE, 100 = TRUE) **
100/100

** Our explanation for veracity score **
According to Statistics Canada, in the first five and a half months following the legalization of cannabis, Canadian governments earned $186 million from excise taxes and general taxes on goods and services directly related to the sale of cannabis. ([www150.statcan.gc.ca](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/daily-quotidien/190619/dq190619e-eng.htm)) This figure aligns with the claim that within the first year of legalizing recreational cannabis, the Canadian government collected over CAD 186 million from cannabis excise and sales taxes.


==== CLAIM 3 ====

** Claim **
"After legalization in 2012, Colorado and Washington reported decreases in illegal cannabis sales and related crime."

** Our veracity score (0 = FALSE, 100 = TRUE) **
85/100

** Our explanation for veracity score **
After the legalization of cannabis in 2012, both Colorado and Washington experienced significant decreases in marijuana-related arrests and certain crime rates. In Colorado, marijuana arrests dropped by 68% between 2012 and 2019, from 13,225 to 4,290. However, the arrest rate for Black individuals remained disproportionately high compared to White individuals. ([publicsafety.colorado.gov](https://publicsafety.colorado.gov/press-release/colorado-division-of-criminal-justice-publishes-report-on-impacts-of-marijuana-0)) In Washington, marijuana possession arrests decreased by 63% between 2012 and 2014, from 5,133 incidents to 1,918. ([ballotpedia.org](https://ballotpedia.org/Fact_check/How_has_marijuana_legalization_impacted_state_revenue_and_crime)) Additionally, a study found that clearance rates for certain crimes improved in both states post-legalization, indicating a positive impact on law enforcement effectiveness. ([news.wsu.edu](https://news.wsu.edu/press-release/2018/07/24/positive-policing-changes-after-cannabis-legalization/)) However, some studies suggest that marijuana legalization and sales have had minimal to no effect on major crimes in these states. ([ojp.gov](https://ojp.gov/library/publications/cannabis-effect-crime-time-series-analysis-crime-colorado-and-washington-state)) Therefore, while there is evidence supporting the claim, some findings indicate minimal impact on major crimes, leading to a veracity score of 85.


==== CLAIM 4 ====

** Claim **
"A study published in the journal Regional Science and Urban Economics indicated a decrease in violent crime rates in states along the Mexican border post-legalization of cannabis in Colorado and Washington."

** Our veracity score (0 = FALSE, 100 = TRUE) **
0/100

** Our explanation for veracity score **
The claim that a study published in the journal Regional Science and Urban Economics indicated a decrease in violent crime rates in states along the Mexican border post-legalization of cannabis in Colorado and Washington is inaccurate. The referenced study, titled 'Not in my backyard? Not so fast. The effect of marijuana legalization on neighborhood crime,' focused on the localized effects of marijuana dispensaries on neighborhood crime rates within Denver, Colorado, and did not examine crime rates in states along the Mexican border.

==== CLAIM 5 ====

** Claim **
"Colorado saw over USD 387 million in tax revenue from cannabis sales in 2020, which has been reinvested in infrastructure, education, and public health initiatives."

** Our veracity score (0 = FALSE, 100 = TRUE) **
100/100

** Our explanation for veracity score **
In 2020, Colorado collected approximately $387.5 million in tax revenue from cannabis sales. This revenue was allocated to various initiatives, including school construction, health education, substance abuse prevention, and treatment programs.

==== CLAIM 6 ====

** Claim **
"Uruguay, as the first country to legalize cannabis nationwide in 2013, took a regulated approach focusing on harm reduction and public health."

** Our veracity score (0 = FALSE, 100 = TRUE) **
100/100

** Our explanation for veracity score **
Uruguay legalized cannabis nationwide in 2013, becoming the first country to do so. The legislation aimed to regulate the production, distribution, and consumption of cannabis, focusing on harm reduction and public health. The law established the Institute for the Regulation and Control of Cannabis (IRCCA) to oversee these activities and promote education and prevention of cannabis use. This approach was intended to reduce the illegal drug market and associated health risks. [Source: Transnational Institute](https://www.tni.org/en/publication/about-drug-law-reform-in-uruguay)


==== CLAIM 7 ====

** Claim **
"The Institute of Regulation and Control of Cannabis in Uruguay indicates that nearly 50% of registered users report buying from licensed sellers, reducing illicit market influence."

** Our veracity score (0 = FALSE, 100 = TRUE) **
0/100

** Our explanation for veracity score **
The claim that nearly 50% of registered users in Uruguay report buying from licensed sellers, reducing illicit market influence, is inaccurate. According to the Institute for the Regulation and Control of Cannabis (IRCCA), only 27% of cannabis consumers purchase through legal channels, with this figure rising to 39% when accounting for sharing among friends. This indicates that a significant majority still rely on the illicit market.

==== CLAIM 8 ====

** Claim **
"Portugal decriminalized all drugs in 2001, and their approach shows a significant reduction in drug-related harm, with drug-related deaths and HIV infections among drug users falling sharply, and incarceration for drug offenses decreasing."

** Our veracity score (0 = FALSE, 100 = TRUE) **
95/100

** Our explanation for veracity score **
Portugal decriminalized the possession and use of all drugs in 2001, focusing on treatment and harm reduction. This approach led to significant reductions in drug-related deaths, HIV infections among drug users, and incarceration for drug offenses. For instance, new HIV cases among drug users dropped from nearly 1,400 in 2000 to about 400 in 2006. Additionally, the proportion of prisoners sentenced for drug offenses fell from over 40% in 2001 to 15.7% in 2019. These outcomes demonstrate the effectiveness of Portugal's health-centered drug policy.
