"The most commonly genetically modified crops include:

1. **Soybeans:** Modified to be herbicide-tolerant, allowing farmers to use certain weed-killers without damaging the crop.
   
2. **Corn:** Modified for herbicide tolerance and pest resistance, particularly against the corn borer pest.
   
3. **Cotton:** Engineered to resist pests like the bollworm, reducing the need for chemical pesticides.
   
4. **Canola:** Developed for herbicide tolerance, which helps manage weeds more effectively.
   
5. **Alfalfa:** Also modified for herbicide resistance, aiding in control of weeds.
   
6. **Sugar beets:** Engineered for herbicide resistance, facilitating more efficient weed control.
   
7. **Papaya:** Modified to be resistant to the Papaya Ringspot Virus, which had devastated the crop in regions like Hawaii.

These modifications primarily focus on increasing yield, reducing pesticide use, and enhancing resistance to environmental stresses. It's important to note that ongoing research and development aim to expand the range of genetically modified crops to address various nutritional and environmental challenges.

By choosing to incorporate these innovations with careful management and monitoring, it could be possible to significantly enhance agricultural sustainability and resilience, supporting the vision of a healthier planet and equitable resources for future generations. Do these types of modifications and their potential benefits resonate with your values of care for the environment and community health?"

======== FACT-CHECKABLE CLAIMS ========


==== CLAIM 1 ====

** Claim **
"Soybeans are genetically modified to be herbicide-tolerant, allowing farmers to use certain weed-killers without damaging the crop."

** Our veracity score (0 = FALSE, 100 = TRUE) **
100/100

** Our explanation for veracity score **
The claim is accurate. Genetically modified (GM) soybeans have been developed to be herbicide-tolerant, allowing farmers to apply specific herbicides without harming the crop. For instance, Bayer's Vyconicâ„¢ soybeans are engineered to tolerate five herbicides: dicamba, glufosinate, mesotrione, 2,4-D, and glyphosate, providing farmers with flexible weed management options. ([bayer.com](https://www.bayer.com/en/us/news-stories/vyconic-soybeans)) Additionally, the Non-GMO Project notes that approximately 95% of soy grown in the United States is genetically engineered for herbicide tolerance, primarily to withstand glyphosate.

==== CLAIM 2 ====

** Claim **
"Corn is genetically modified for herbicide tolerance and pest resistance, particularly against the corn borer pest."

** Our veracity score (0 = FALSE, 100 = TRUE) **
100/100

** Our explanation for veracity score **
Genetically modified (GM) corn has been engineered to exhibit both herbicide tolerance and pest resistance, particularly against the European corn borer. Herbicide-tolerant varieties, such as those resistant to glyphosate, allow farmers to apply specific herbicides without harming the crop. Insect-resistant GM corn, commonly known as Bt corn, produces proteins from the bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) that are toxic to certain pests, including the European corn borer. This dual modification has been widely adopted to enhance crop yields and reduce losses due to pests and weeds.

==== CLAIM 3 ====

** Claim **
"Cotton is genetically engineered to resist pests like the bollworm, reducing the need for chemical pesticides."

** Our veracity score (0 = FALSE, 100 = TRUE) **
100/100

** Our explanation for veracity score **
Genetically engineered cotton, specifically Bt cotton, has been developed to produce insecticidal proteins from Bacillus thuringiensis, effectively controlling pests like the bollworm and reducing the need for chemical pesticides. Studies have shown that Bt cotton significantly decreases bollworm populations and associated pesticide use. For instance, in the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, the introduction of Bt cotton, combined with other control measures, led to the eradication of the pink bollworm, resulting in substantial economic and environmental benefits. ([pnas.org](https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.2019115118)) Similarly, in China, the widespread adoption of Bt cotton has been associated with a marked decrease in regional outbreaks of the cotton bollworm across multiple crops, further reducing the need for insecticide sprays.

==== CLAIM 4 ====

** Claim **
"Canola is developed for herbicide tolerance, which helps manage weeds more effectively."

** Our veracity score (0 = FALSE, 100 = TRUE) **
100/100

** Our explanation for veracity score **
Canola has been genetically modified to tolerate specific herbicides, such as glyphosate and glufosinate, enabling more effective weed management. This modification allows farmers to apply these herbicides without harming the canola crop, leading to improved weed control and reduced tillage. For instance, glyphosate-tolerant canola varieties have been developed to withstand applications of glyphosate, facilitating efficient weed management.

==== CLAIM 5 ====

** Claim **
"Alfalfa is genetically modified for herbicide resistance, aiding in control of weeds."

** Our veracity score (0 = FALSE, 100 = TRUE) **
100/100

** Our explanation for veracity score **
Genetically modified alfalfa has been developed to be resistant to glyphosate, a common herbicide, allowing for effective weed control. This trait, known as Roundup Ready alfalfa, was first deregulated in the United States in 2005, enabling farmers to use glyphosate for weed management without harming the alfalfa crop. ([federalregister.gov](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2011/02/02/2011-2268/determination-of-regulated-status-of-alfalfa-genetically-engineered-for-tolerance-to-the-herbicide)) Additionally, research has introduced genes like GR79Ms into alfalfa, enhancing its glyphosate resistance. ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29687223/)) Therefore, the claim that alfalfa is genetically modified for herbicide resistance to aid in weed control is accurate.


==== CLAIM 6 ====

** Claim **
"Sugar beets are engineered for herbicide resistance, facilitating more efficient weed control."

** Our veracity score (0 = FALSE, 100 = TRUE) **
100/100

** Our explanation for veracity score **
Genetically modified sugar beets have been engineered for herbicide resistance, particularly to glyphosate, allowing for more efficient weed control. This modification enables farmers to apply glyphosate directly to the crop, effectively managing weeds without harming the sugar beets. The adoption of glyphosate-resistant sugar beets has significantly reduced the complexity of weed management and decreased the need for multiple herbicide applications. ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27991715/))


==== CLAIM 7 ====

** Claim **
"Papaya is genetically modified to be resistant to the Papaya Ringspot Virus, which had devastated the crop in regions like Hawaii."

** Our veracity score (0 = FALSE, 100 = TRUE) **
100/100

** Our explanation for veracity score **
The claim is entirely accurate. In response to the devastation caused by Papaya Ringspot Virus (PRSV) in Hawaii, scientists developed genetically modified papaya varieties, such as 'SunUp' and 'Rainbow', which are resistant to PRSV. These transgenic papayas were introduced to save Hawaii's papaya industry from collapse.
