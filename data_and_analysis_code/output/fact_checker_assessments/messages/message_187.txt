"That's an excellent question, and one of the key advantages of investing in nuclear energy is its potential to stabilize and even reduce energy costs in the long term. While the initial capital investment in nuclear infrastructure can be higher compared to some energy sources, the long-term operational costs are relatively low. Once a nuclear plant is up and running, it can produce large amounts of electricity consistently without the volatility of fuel costs that affect fossil-fuel-based power plants.

Moreover, nuclear plants have very long lifespans, often exceeding 40 years, and they generate electricity around the clock, minimizing the need for costly backup power solutions often required for intermittent renewable sources. This reliability in generation helps keep the grid stable and reduces the risk of price spikes due to energy shortages.

Additionally, investing in modern nuclear technology, like small modular reactors, can further reduce construction and operational costs. These reactors are designed to be cheaper and quicker to build and are expected to be more cost-competitive.

As more countries adopt nuclear technology and with advancements driving costs down, the global market dynamics could also lead to lower energy prices. Plus, investing in nuclear could hedge against future uncertainties in fossil fuel markets, providing a stable and sustainable energy supply.

Given these potential benefits, enhancing nuclear energy investment presents an opportunity not only for energy security but also for potentially lower and more stable electricity bills in the future. Is energy cost stability something you think should be prioritized in energy policy discussions?"

==== CLAIM 1 ====

** Claim **
"Investing in nuclear energy has the potential to stabilize and even reduce energy costs in the long term."

** Our veracity score (0 = FALSE, 100 = TRUE) **
75/100

** Our explanation for veracity score **
Investing in nuclear energy has the potential to stabilize and reduce long-term energy costs due to its low operating expenses and ability to provide consistent, low-carbon electricity. However, high initial construction costs, lengthy project timelines, and potential cost overruns can offset these benefits. For instance, the UK's Sizewell C nuclear project is expected to cost nearly Â£40 billion, double its initial estimate, raising concerns about financial viability and impact on consumer energy bills. ([ft.com](https://www.ft.com/content/0b483728-de5b-4f2e-8d00-c49885c572c9)) Therefore, while nuclear energy can contribute to long-term cost stability, these economic challenges must be carefully managed.


==== CLAIM 2 ====

** Claim **
"The initial capital investment in nuclear infrastructure can be higher compared to some energy sources."

** Our veracity score (0 = FALSE, 100 = TRUE) **
100/100

** Our explanation for veracity score **
The claim is accurate. Nuclear power plants have higher initial capital investment compared to some other energy sources. For instance, in the United States, the estimated capital costs for nuclear power plants range between $8,475 and $13,925 per kilowatt, whereas natural gas-fired power plants have lower construction costs. This significant difference underscores the higher upfront investment required for nuclear infrastructure.

==== CLAIM 3 ====

** Claim **
"The long-term operational costs of nuclear energy are relatively low."

** Our veracity score (0 = FALSE, 100 = TRUE) **
85/100

** Our explanation for veracity score **
The claim that the long-term operational costs of nuclear energy are relatively low is largely accurate. While nuclear power plants have high initial construction costs, their operational expenses, including fuel and maintenance, are comparatively low. For instance, the variable operation and maintenance cost, primarily fuel, for advanced nuclear plants is about $9 per megawatt-hour, significantly lower than that of coal or natural gas plants. Additionally, the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) for existing nuclear plants is competitive with other energy sources, making them cost-effective over their operational lifespan. However, it's important to note that while operational costs are low, the overall economic viability of nuclear energy also depends on factors like construction costs, regulatory requirements, and waste management.


==== CLAIM 4 ====

** Claim **
"Once a nuclear plant is up and running, it can produce large amounts of electricity consistently without the volatility of fuel costs that affect fossil-fuel-based power plants."

** Our veracity score (0 = FALSE, 100 = TRUE) **
95/100

** Our explanation for veracity score **
Nuclear power plants are highly reliable, operating at over 92% capacity factor, and their fuel costs are relatively stable compared to fossil fuels. However, while fuel costs are less volatile, nuclear plants do face high initial capital costs and potential maintenance expenses.


==== CLAIM 5 ====

** Claim **
"Nuclear plants have very long lifespans, often exceeding 40 years."

** Our veracity score (0 = FALSE, 100 = TRUE) **
100/100

** Our explanation for veracity score **
Nuclear power plants are initially licensed for 40 years, but many have received extensions allowing operation up to 60 or even 80 years. For instance, the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission has granted 20-year license extensions to numerous reactors, enabling them to operate for 60 years, with some applying for further extensions to reach 80 years. ([iaea.org](https://www.iaea.org/newscenter/news/going-long-term-us-nuclear-power-plants-could-extend-operating-life-to-80-years)) Similarly, in the UK, EDF has extended the operation of several nuclear power stations beyond their original closure dates to enhance energy security. ([ft.com](https://www.ft.com/content/77cf3ac9-de0a-4dbf-aa28-8b6ffcd3ebe2)) These examples demonstrate that nuclear plants often exceed 40 years of operation.


==== CLAIM 6 ====

** Claim **
"Nuclear plants generate electricity around the clock, minimizing the need for costly backup power solutions often required for intermittent renewable sources."

** Our veracity score (0 = FALSE, 100 = TRUE) **
95/100

** Our explanation for veracity score **
Nuclear power plants operate with high capacity factors, often exceeding 90%, providing consistent, around-the-clock electricity generation. This reliability reduces the need for backup power solutions that are typically required to compensate for the intermittency of renewable energy sources like wind and solar, which have lower capacity factors due to their dependence on weather conditions.

==== CLAIM 7 ====

** Claim **
"Investing in modern nuclear technology, like small modular reactors, can further reduce construction and operational costs."

** Our veracity score (0 = FALSE, 100 = TRUE) **
60/100

** Our explanation for veracity score **
Investing in modern nuclear technology, such as small modular reactors (SMRs), has the potential to reduce construction and operational costs through modular design and factory fabrication. However, these cost reductions are largely theoretical at this stage. Studies indicate that significant economies of scale would require the production of thousands of units, and current SMR projects have faced cost overruns and delays. Therefore, while SMRs may offer cost benefits in the future, current evidence does not fully support this claim. ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_modular_reactor), [ieefa.org](https://ieefa.org/articles/small-modular-reactors-are-still-too-expensive-too-slow-and-too-risky))


==== CLAIM 8 ====

** Claim **
"Small modular reactors are designed to be cheaper and quicker to build and are expected to be more cost-competitive."

** Our veracity score (0 = FALSE, 100 = TRUE) **
60/100

** Our explanation for veracity score **
Small modular reactors (SMRs) are designed to be cheaper and quicker to build, aiming for cost-competitiveness. However, real-world data indicates that SMRs have faced significant cost overruns and construction delays. For instance, the NuScale project in the U.S. was canceled after projected costs escalated from $3.6 billion to $9.3 billion, with the estimated cost per megawatt-hour rising from $60 to nearly $100. Additionally, the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA) reports that SMRs remain too expensive and slow to build to play a significant role in the near-term energy transition. Therefore, while the design intentions of SMRs align with the claim, practical experiences suggest that achieving these goals has been challenging.

==== CLAIM 9 ====

** Claim **
"As more countries adopt nuclear technology and with advancements driving costs down, the global market dynamics could lead to lower energy prices."

** Our veracity score (0 = FALSE, 100 = TRUE) **
70/100

** Our explanation for veracity score **
The claim that increased adoption of nuclear technology and advancements leading to reduced costs could result in lower global energy prices is partially accurate. The International Energy Agency (IEA) projects a significant increase in nuclear capacity by 2050, indicating a global shift towards nuclear energy. ([iea.org](https://www.iea.org/reports/the-path-to-a-new-era-for-nuclear-energy)) However, while nuclear energy can enhance energy security and contribute to decarbonization, the direct impact on lowering global energy prices is uncertain. Challenges such as high initial costs, regulatory hurdles, and competition from renewable energy sources may limit the extent to which nuclear energy adoption reduces overall energy prices.

==== CLAIM 10 ====

** Claim **
"Investing in nuclear could hedge against future uncertainties in fossil fuel markets, providing a stable and sustainable energy supply."

** Our veracity score (0 = FALSE, 100 = TRUE) **
90/100

** Our explanation for veracity score **
Investing in nuclear energy can indeed hedge against future uncertainties in fossil fuel markets by providing a stable and sustainable energy supply. Nuclear power offers a reliable source of low-carbon electricity, reducing dependence on imported fossil fuels and mitigating exposure to their price volatility. The International Energy Agency (IEA) highlights that nuclear energy contributes to energy security and supports clean energy transitions by offering a secure and flexible electricity supply. ([iaea.org](https://www.iaea.org/newscenter/news/nuclear-power-supports-clean-energy-transition-with-secure-and-flexible-electricity-supply)) Additionally, the World Nuclear Association emphasizes that nuclear power plants provide large amounts of clean, reliable, and affordable energy, complementing renewable sources like wind and solar to develop a low-carbon electricity grid. ([world-nuclear.org](https://world-nuclear.org/climate-change-and-nuclear-energy/sustainable-development-goals-and-nuclear/sdg7-affordable-and-clean-energy)) However, challenges such as high initial capital costs, long construction times, and public concerns about safety and waste management can impact the feasibility and public acceptance of nuclear energy projects.
