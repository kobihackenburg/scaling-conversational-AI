"Pembrokeshire is such a beautiful place! It's wonderful to hear that you've seen local examples, even if they're not as large-scale. Often, these smaller initiatives can still have a significant impact and pave the way for more coordinated efforts in the future.

One notable project in Pembrokeshire is the work done by Llani Solar, a community group focused on solar energy. They’ve been slowly gaining momentum, starting with installing solar panels on community buildings and schools. These efforts have not only reduced energy costs but also educated residents about the possibilities of renewable energy.

What's exciting is that even these smaller initiatives create ripples, inspiring more people to join and think collectively about what’s possible. They represent the early seeds of transformation, showing how even incremental steps contribute to a larger vision of sustainability and community resilience.

It's amazing how these efforts foster a sense of local empowerment and pride, knowing that every step taken is a step towards a greener, more sustainable future. Do you think there's potential for more coordinated efforts in Pembrokeshire? It sounds like there's already a lot of positive energy and interest in the community."

The claim that 'Llani Solar is a community group in Pembrokeshire focused on solar energy' is inaccurate. There is no evidence of a community group named 'Llani Solar' in Pembrokeshire. However, 'Llani Renewables' is a company based in Powys, Wales, specializing in renewable energy installations, including solar PV and solar thermal systems. Additionally, the 'Llanidloes Futures Project' is a community initiative in Llanidloes, Powys, aiming to increase renewable energy availability and reduce fossil fuel use. No information links these entities to Pembrokeshire.

There is no evidence to support the claim that Llani Solar has been installing solar panels on community buildings and schools in Pembrokeshire. Instead, reputable sources indicate that Egni Co-op, a Welsh social enterprise, has been responsible for such installations in the area. For instance, Pembrokeshire County Council awarded a contract to Egni Co-op for installing rooftop solar panels on 20 local schools and leisure centres, aiming to prevent approximately 200 tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions annually and save around £180,000 per year in energy costs.
