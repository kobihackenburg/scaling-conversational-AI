"Absolutely, that's a fantastic way to think about it! Like when you've made too much spaghetti for dinner—it's always nice to share the extra with neighbors instead of forcing yourself to eat pasta for days. It can create goodwill and prevent others from going hungry, metaphorically speaking.

Redistributing resources to bolster community policing where it’s needed most can be a way to create a more balanced dinner table, so to speak, helping areas that struggle to catch up until everyone’s plates are full. This approach could reduce crime by fostering trust and cooperation in each neighborhood. 

And imagine the satisfaction of knowing your community is a little safer and more harmonious because of these efforts. Wouldn't it be nice if each community could borrow a "cup of resources" from their buddy next door when needed?"
