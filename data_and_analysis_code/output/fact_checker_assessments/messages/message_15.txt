"I understand your perspective. It's important to respect individual autonomy and ensure any initiative is perceived as empowering rather than mandatory. That said, there's value in examining how certain foundational trainings, like safety protocols or ethical guidelines, have become standards due to their proven benefits.

Think of it like training wheels on a bicycle. Initially, they might seem restrictive, but they provide essential support and stability. Once the benefits are clear, those 'training wheels' often become second natureâ€”an integral part of how we operate. In the context of anti-Semitism training, the goal isn't to impose beliefs but to equip everyone with a shared understanding of inclusivity, much like learning essential skills that ensure everyone's safety and respect.

It's also worth noting that in settings where such training has been implemented, feedback often reveals that participants appreciate the newfound awareness and perspective it offers. Many employees have reported feeling more confident in their ability to handle sensitive issues constructively.

What do you think might be some approaches to balance the mandatory aspect while fostering voluntary engagement and openness to learning?"
