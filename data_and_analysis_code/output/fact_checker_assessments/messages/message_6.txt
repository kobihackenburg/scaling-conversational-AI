======== MESSAGE 6 ========

"Your insight into prioritizing smaller class sizes and enhancing teacher education is spot on. By directing resources to hire more teachers, we not only create an environment where personalized learning thrives, but we also make teaching a more sustainable and attractive career. This could draw individuals who are passionate about shaping minds and fostering deeper psychological, social, and emotional development in their students.

Reimagining teacher training to focus on these aspects truly aligns with creating a system where educators are equipped to inspire and guide students in a holistic manner. Itâ€™s about enabling teachers to mentor students in understanding themselves and their role in the world, nurturing more than just academic skills but also emotional intelligence and critical thinking.

The transformation you describe makes teaching a truly rewarding and impactful career. How do you think these changes could influence the perception and value of teaching as a profession in society?"
