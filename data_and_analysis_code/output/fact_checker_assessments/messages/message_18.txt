======== MESSAGE 18 ========

"It's wonderful that you have a genuine desire to contribute when the time is right for you. Balancing work and family commitments is no small task, and it's entirely understandable that your current focus needs to be on those priorities. The fact that you’re already thinking ahead about how you can make a difference speaks volumes about your compassion and foresight.

Keeping these intentions in mind for the future means you’ll be ready to jump in when the opportunity aligns with your schedule. In the meantime, perhaps staying informed about the organizations and causes you're interested in can help prepare you for when you're able to get involved. Maybe even just reaching out for some initial information could be beneficial, so you have an idea of where you'd like to lend your efforts down the line.

Your empathy, especially as we approach the holiday season, can be a powerful motivator to inspire others around you—family, friends, colleagues—to perhaps consider small ways they can help too. Sometimes, simply sharing your intentions can spark collaborative efforts where time, resources, or even encouragement can be shared among a group.

Whenever you do find the time, know that your contributions will be deeply valued and impactful. If there's ever a small way to engage or stay connected, even amidst your busy schedule, it might keep the flame alive for when you're ready to dive in. Thank you for your thoughtful commitment to making a positive impact, even from the sidelines right now!"
