"Several countries around the world rely significantly on nuclear energy as a part of their power generation mix. Some of the key nations include:

1. **France**: France is a global leader in nuclear energy, generating about 70-75% of its electricity from nuclear power. The country has invested heavily in nuclear infrastructure over the decades.

2. **United States**: The US has the largest number of operational nuclear reactors and produces around 20% of its electricity from nuclear energy.

3. **China**: China has rapidly expanded its nuclear energy sector as part of its efforts to reduce air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. It plans to increase its nuclear output significantly in the coming years.

4. **Russia**: Russia relies on nuclear power for about 20% of its electricity. The country is also a major builder of nuclear reactors for other countries.

5. **South Korea**: South Korea generates about 25-30% of its electricity from nuclear power and has plans to continue its development.

6. **Japan**: Japan has historically relied on nuclear energy, though its reliance has fluctuated since the Fukushima disaster in 2011. The country has been gradually restarting reactors that meet new safety standards.

7. **Canada**: Approximately 15% of Canada's electricity comes from nuclear power, primarily in the province of Ontario.

8. **Germany**: Historically relied on nuclear energy but has been phasing it out as part of its "Energiewende" policy, aiming to transition to renewable sources.

These countries, among others, demonstrate the potential for nuclear energy to contribute to a stable and reliable energy mix. Let me know if you want more details on any specific country's nuclear policies!"

======== FACT-CHECKABLE CLAIMS ========


==== CLAIM 1 ====

** Claim **
"France generates about 70-75% of its electricity from nuclear power."

** Our veracity score (0 = FALSE, 100 = TRUE) **
95/100

** Our explanation for veracity score **
The claim that France generates about 70-75% of its electricity from nuclear power is largely accurate. In 2021, nuclear power accounted for 68% of France's electricity generation, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. ([eia.gov](https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=55259&utm_source=openai)) The World Nuclear Association reports that France derives about 70% of its electricity from nuclear energy. ([world-nuclear.org](https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/country-profiles/countries-a-f/france?3mE9YN=EOgOCVUmKty7&utm_source=openai)) Therefore, the claim is well-supported by these sources.


==== CLAIM 2 ====

** Claim **
"The United States has the largest number of operational nuclear reactors and produces around 20% of its electricity from nuclear energy."

** Our veracity score (0 = FALSE, 100 = TRUE) **
100/100

** Our explanation for veracity score **
The United States has the largest number of operational nuclear reactors, with 94 units as of May 2024, and these reactors produced approximately 18.5% of the nation's electricity in 2023. ([statista.com](https://www.statista.com/statistics/267158/number-of-nuclear-reactors-in-operation-by-country/), [nei.org](https://www.nei.org/resources/statistics/world-nuclear-generation-and-capacity/))


==== CLAIM 3 ====

** Claim **
"China plans to increase its nuclear output significantly in the coming years as part of its efforts to reduce air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions."

** Our veracity score (0 = FALSE, 100 = TRUE) **
95/100

** Our explanation for veracity score **
China has approved the construction of multiple new nuclear reactors and plans to maintain a steady pace of six to eight new units annually. This expansion aims to increase nuclear power's share in the country's electricity generation to 10% by 2035 and 18% by 2060, supporting efforts to reduce air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions.

==== CLAIM 4 ====

** Claim **
"Russia relies on nuclear power for about 20% of its electricity and is a major builder of nuclear reactors for other countries."

** Our veracity score (0 = FALSE, 100 = TRUE) **
100/100

** Our explanation for veracity score **
Russia generates approximately 20% of its electricity from nuclear power and is a leading exporter of nuclear reactors, constructing about 20 units abroad.


==== CLAIM 5 ====

** Claim **
"South Korea generates about 25-30% of its electricity from nuclear power and has plans to continue its development."

** Our veracity score (0 = FALSE, 100 = TRUE) **
100/100

** Our explanation for veracity score **
As of 2023, nuclear power accounted for approximately 30.7% of South Korea's electricity generation, aligning with the claim's 25-30% range. The country has plans to increase this share to 35.2% by 2038, including constructing two new large-scale nuclear reactors and one small modular reactor. ([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/south-korea-plans-two-new-large-nuclear-reactors-more-renewables-energy-mix-2025-02-21/)) These developments confirm South Korea's commitment to expanding its nuclear power capacity.


==== CLAIM 6 ====

** Claim **
"Japan has been gradually restarting reactors that meet new safety standards since the Fukushima disaster in 2011."

** Our veracity score (0 = FALSE, 100 = TRUE) **
100/100

** Our explanation for veracity score **
The claim is accurate. Since the Fukushima disaster in 2011, Japan has been gradually restarting nuclear reactors that meet new safety standards. As of late 2024, 14 reactors have been restarted after implementing extensive safety upgrades. For instance, the Onagawa No. 2 reactor resumed operations in October 2024 following significant safety enhancements, including the construction of a 29-meter-high anti-tsunami wall. This restart marked the first operation of a reactor of the same type as those damaged in the Fukushima disaster. These efforts are part of Japan's broader plan to expand nuclear energy to ensure a stable power supply and reduce carbon emissions.

==== CLAIM 7 ====

** Claim **
"Approximately 15% of Canada's electricity comes from nuclear power, primarily in the province of Ontario."

** Our veracity score (0 = FALSE, 100 = TRUE) **
100/100

** Our explanation for veracity score **
The claim is accurate. Approximately 15% of Canada's electricity is generated from nuclear power, with the majority of nuclear reactors located in Ontario. Specifically, 18 of Canada's 19 commercial reactors are situated in Ontario, supplying about 60% of the province's electricity. This information is corroborated by multiple reputable sources, including the World Nuclear Association and the International Atomic Energy Agency.


==== CLAIM 8 ====

** Claim **
"Germany has been phasing out nuclear energy as part of its 'Energiewende' policy, aiming to transition to renewable sources."

** Our veracity score (0 = FALSE, 100 = TRUE) **
100/100

** Our explanation for veracity score **
Germany's 'Energiewende' policy involves phasing out nuclear energy and transitioning to renewable sources. The country shut down its last three nuclear power plants in April 2023, completing the phase-out. This aligns with Germany's goal to increase renewable energy's share in electricity consumption to 80% by 2030.
