==== CLAIM 1 ====

** Claim **
"Historically, coal has been a significant energy source in the U.K."

** Our veracity score (0 = FALSE, 100 = TRUE) **
100/100

** Our explanation for veracity score **
The claim that coal has historically been a significant energy source in the U.K. is entirely accurate. Coal played a central role in powering the Industrial Revolution, with its use expanding significantly in the 18th and 19th centuries. By 1950, coal accounted for 97% of the U.K.'s electricity generation. However, its dominance has declined over recent decades, culminating in the closure of the last coal-fired power plant, Ratcliffe-on-Soar, in September 2024. This marked the end of over 140 years of coal-powered electricity generation in the U.K. [Source: Energy UK, 'The UK and coal: a history', 30 Sep 2024](https://www.energy-uk.org.uk/publications/theuk-and-coal-a-history/)
