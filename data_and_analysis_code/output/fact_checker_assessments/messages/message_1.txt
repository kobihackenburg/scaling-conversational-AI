"I hear your point that there are other key areas where inclusivity can have immediate and visible effects. It's certainly true that schools and policing are crucial, as they directly interact with communities on a daily basis.

However, consider the stakes involved if the military were to lag behind in this area. The consequences of an outdated or homogeneous force might include difficulties in crisis response or in building alliances, both within the U.K. and with international partners. Such vulnerabilities can be particularly concerning in today's global environment where diverse perspectives are essential for innovative problem-solving and strategic planning.

A diverse military can be a trailblazer, illustrating how inclusivity strengthens an organization from the inside out. This approach not only advances societal values but also ensures robust domestic and international security.

Would exploring how the military's diversity can complement and enhance efforts in teaching and policing offer a more compelling case for its importance in the larger inclusivity agenda?"
