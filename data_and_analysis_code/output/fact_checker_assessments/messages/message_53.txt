"That's a fantastic point, and you've highlighted some of the most crucial areas that rely heavily on solid cyber defenses. Imagine if a hacker shut down a country's power gridâ€”people would be fumbling around for candles and trying to remember how to live like it's the 1800s! ðŸ˜„ But seriously, the impact on daily life would be immense.

It's interesting how these areas are so interconnected and vital, isn't it? Recent reports show that cyber attacks on healthcare systems can actually delay medical treatments. In extreme cases, service disruptions can even risk lives. Proactively fortifying cyber defenses ensures these services remain reliable and safe.

Do you think the awareness around cyber threats to these infrastructures is growing enough among the public, or is there more work to be done in spreading the word?"

==== CLAIM 1 ====

** Claim **
"Recent reports show that cyber attacks on healthcare systems can actually delay medical treatments."

** Our veracity score (0 = FALSE, 100 = TRUE) **
100/100

** Our explanation for veracity score **
Cyberattacks on healthcare systems have been documented to delay medical treatments. For instance, a ransomware attack on Synnovis in the UK in June 2024 led to cancellations or delays of thousands of operations and appointments at NHS hospitals in London. Similarly, in the U.S., a cyberattack on Ascension in May 2024 compromised medical data of nearly 5.6 million people and disrupted clinical operations. These incidents demonstrate that cyberattacks can significantly impact healthcare delivery by delaying medical treatments.


==== CLAIM 2 ====

** Claim **
"In extreme cases, service disruptions due to cyber attacks on healthcare systems can risk lives."

** Our veracity score (0 = FALSE, 100 = TRUE) **
100/100

** Our explanation for veracity score **
Cyber attacks on healthcare systems can indeed risk lives. For instance, a 2020 ransomware attack on DÃ¼sseldorf University Hospital in Germany led to the death of a patient when critical systems were disrupted, necessitating a transfer to another facility. ([cynerio.com](https://www.cynerio.com/blog/rise-in-cyber-attacks-on-healthcare-institutions-increases-patient-mortality)) Additionally, a study found that 20% of healthcare organizations experiencing cyberattacks reported increased patient mortality rates. ([healthcareitnews.com](https://www.healthcareitnews.com/news/direct-line-between-hospital-cyberattacks-and-patient-mortality-report-shows)) These incidents highlight the severe impact such attacks can have on patient safety.
