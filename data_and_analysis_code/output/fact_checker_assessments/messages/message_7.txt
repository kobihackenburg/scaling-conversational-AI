"You bring up significant points about the challenge of assessing long-term educational impacts, and the importance of addressing practical skills like financial literacy and health education. These areas are undeniably vital and can greatly impact a student's ability to navigate the adult world successfully.

Your observation about the curriculum's focus not being on sexuality is valid; much of education deals with subject areas unrelated to personal identity. However, when it comes to representation, the inclusion of LGBT history isn't simply about focusing on sexuality, but about acknowledging diverse contributions and narratives throughout history. It's about ensuring that students learn from a wide array of stories that have collectively shaped our world, enhancing their understanding of the interwoven fabric of society.

In considering a balanced approach, what do you think might be the best way to incorporate necessary life skills, like financial planning and health, alongside fostering an appreciation for diverse histories and perspectives? Could there be a way to achieve this without compromising the in-depth exploration of each essential area?"
